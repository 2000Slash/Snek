# Snek

This is a basic Snake clone written in SDL2. It also uses SDL_ttf 2 and SDL_img 2. A basic CMakeLists is included for generating build environments on windows and linux. If you want to compile for the switch, you can use the MakefileSwitch. This expects the data folder to contain compilable sources, so you have to delete it first. All images are drawn by me. The font used is Opensans and is licensed under Apache 2.
